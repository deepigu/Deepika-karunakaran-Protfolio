        <h3> <center> My Student Life..</center></h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Deepika  karunakaranand I am currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s   degree in BA ITEC at York University.

<br> <br> 
I live in Oshawa, Canada for more than two years.  

<br> <br> 
I am passionate about Programming.
<br> <br> 
Throughout my academic journey, I have maintained a  strong focus on programming. I have actively sought out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills  through various coursework and research projects.
<br> <br>
One area of particular interest to me is Coding. I have  dedicated myself to exploring this field in depth, delving into topics such as Creating a website, doing   different projects. This academic pursuit has not only deepened my understanding but has also ignited my curiosity to further explore its applications in real-world scenarios.
<br> <br>  
In addition to my academic achievements, I have  gained practical experience through assignments and  project. For instance, I had the opportunity to intern at  Motion specialties, where I collaborated with a team to design  the website. This experience allowed me to apply the knowledge   gained in the classroom and provided valuable knowledge.
